# Tutorial

Hello, space explorer! We are glad you wanna try out restQL to explore the universe! Do you have what it takes to make the most out of this tool? Don't worry, this tutorial will be your guide! RestQL is quite simple, learning it should take less effort than reversing the polarity of the neutron flow, this won't take long.

In this tutorial you'll learn how you can query a RESTful API (in this case, the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)), and build your project locally.

This tutorial is freely inspired by [Apollo GraphQL's tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction), thanks for the inspiration, buddies! Also, thanks for making all this real data available, [SpaceX](https://docs.spacexdata.com/), you guys rock!

## System Requirements
As prerequisites to build restQL-http from source we need:

- Golang 1.15 or higher
- Make utility

## Preparing for Battle
Simply clone the project from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/b2wdigital/restQL-golang) and create a file called `restql.yml` anywhere you want - we'll get there soon.

We also recommend using a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
