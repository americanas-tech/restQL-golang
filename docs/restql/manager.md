# restQL-manager

[restQL-manager](https://github.com/b2wdigital/restQL-manager) allows you to easily develop and test new queries, save resources endpoints, check resources status and save queries that can be used by clients just referencing the query's name.

restQL-manager requires a [restQL](https://github.com/b2wdigital/restQL-golang) running instance.

## Installation

### NPM

**restQL-manager** can be installed with [`@b2wdigital/restQL-manager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@b2wdigital/restQL-manager) npm package and run it directely from the shell.

```shell
$ npm i -g @b2wdigital/restQL-manager
$ restQL-manager
```

### Docker

The official **restQL-manager** docker image can be pulled from `b2wdigital/restQL-manager` repository.

#### Basic usage:

```shell
$ docker run -p 9000:9000 b2wdigital/restQL-manager:latest
```

#### Custom configuration:

```shell
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e RESTQL_MANAGER_PORT=8080 ... b2wdigital/restQL-manager:latest
```

## Configuration

restQL-manager uses the following environment variables for its configuration:

- `RESTQL_SERVER_URL`. This will set the [restQL](https://github.com/b2wdigital/restQL-golang) instance that will run the queries.
- `RESTQL_MANAGER_PORT`. Default is `3000`. Set this variable to change the TCP port to be bound.
- `MONGO_URL`. This should point to the same mongoDB instances used by the referenced [restQL](https://github.com/b2wdigital/restQL-golang).

## Development server

To install restQL-manager dependecies run:

```shell
yarn install
```

To start the development server, run:

```shell
yarn server:start
```

In another shell, run:

```shell
yarn start
```

Access http://localhost:5000/.

## Production build

To build a production bundle, run:

```shell
yarn build
```

You can now start the server:

```shell
node src/server
```

restQL-manager will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`

## restQL-manager Endpoints

By default the restQL-manager run on port 3000 and provides a web and REST interface to manipualte queries, revisions and resources.

#### Web Admin

`GET /` A Web interface for running and saving queries.

#### Saving Queries

`POST /ns/:namespace/query/:queryId` with the query as the POST body, where `:namespace` is the namespace you want to publish the query and `:queryId` is your query unique name inside that namespace.

#### Retrieving Available Resources

The route `GET http://localhost:3000/resources/:tenant` will return the following response:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "url": "https://swapi.co/api/planets/:id",
      "base-url": "https://swapi.co",
      "status": 200,
      "name": "planets"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards/:id",
      "base-url": "http://api.magicthegathering.io",
      "status": 200,
      "name": "card"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where `status = 200` means that the resource is reachable.

#### Retrieving Saved Queries

The route `GET http://localhost:3000/ns/:namespace` will return the following response:

```json
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "id": "cards",
      "revisions": "/ns/foo/query/cards",
      "last-revision": "/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/7"
    },
    {
      "id": "cardsByType",
      "revisions": "/ns/foo/query/cardsByType",
      "last-revision": "/ns/foo/query/cardsByType/revision/1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:

- id: the query id to be used when running the query, e.g. `GET http://localhost:9000/run-query/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/1`.
- revisions: the server route to retrieve all revisions of the given query.
- last-revision: the route to retrieve the last revision's saved query string.

#### Retrieving Saved Queries Revision

The route `GET http://localhost:3000/ns/:namespace/query/:queryId/`, with a given `queryId = cards`, will return the following response:

```json
{
  "revisions": [
    {
      "index": 3,
      "link": "/run-query/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/3",
      "query": "/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/3"
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "link": "/run-query/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/2",
      "query": "/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/2"
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "link": "/run-query/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/1",
      "query": "/ns/foo/query/cards/revision/1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:

- index: the revision number
- link: the route to run the query saved for the given revision.
- query: the route to retrieve the revision's saved query string.

#### Retrieving All Revisions of a Saved Query

The route `GET http://localhost:3000/ns/:namespace/:queryId`, given `namespace=deck` and `queryId = cards`, will retrieve the imaginary query revisions:

```json
{
  "namespace": "deck",
  "queryName": "cards",
  "revisionsCount": 2,
  "revisions": [
    {
      "text": "from cards\n with suit = spades"
    },
    {
      "text": "from cards\n timeout 5000\n with suit = hearts\n ignore-errors"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Retrieving Saved Queries String

The route `GET http://localhost:3000/ns/:namespace/query/:queryId/revision/:index`, given `queryId = cards` and `index = 1`, will retrieve the imaginary query:

```restql
from cards
  with suit = spades
```
